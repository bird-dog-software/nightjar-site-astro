This week's update was pretty good.

First, the game, and this website, is now in Github. Not a big milestone by any means, but good
to know that I won't lose my work, or too much of my work.

The game now has a simple main menu. Admittedly, it was easier to put together than I thought
it would be. The menu acts as a "Room" in GameMaker, has centered text, a and .gif as a sprite
for the background.

The way selection is done is:

```rb
// create event
menu_pointer = 0;
menu_items[0] = "NEW GAME";
menu_items[1] = "BRIEFING";
menu_items[2] = "CREDITS";
menu_items[3] = "EXIT GAME";

// step event
var _up_key     = keyboard_check_released(ord("W"));
var _down_key   = keyboard_check_released(ord("S"));
var _z_key      = keyboard_check_released(ord("Z"));

if _up_key {
    menu_pointer -= 1;
    if menu_pointer < 0 {
        menu_pointer = array_length(menu_items) - 1;
    }
    audio_play_sound(snd_menu_select, 0, false);
}

if _down_key {
    menu_pointer += 1;
    if menu_pointer > array_length(menu_items) - 1 {
        menu_pointer = 0;
    }
    audio_play_sound(snd_menu_select, 0, false);
}

if _z_key {
    audio_play_sound(snd_main_menu_confirm, 0, false);
    switch(menu_pointer) {
        case 0:
            room_goto(rm_test_0); // first level
            break;
        case 1:
            room_goto(rm_briefing);
            break;
        case 2:
            room_goto(rm_credits);
            break;
        case 3:
            game_end(0);
            break;
    }
}
```

And that is literally all the code required. I don't show it in today's update video, but
BRIEFING and CREDITS are rooms that exist, but there's nothing in them.

As shown, the player can now move between rooms. Again, this was easier than I thought it would
be and makes sense upon seeing the concept. I have an empty obj_warp that when the player
collides with, just like standard collisions, "warps" them to a new room at a given x and y
location. There is some more work to be done here perhaps on fade outs/fade ins, but the core
concept is there. I've linked my resource for this above.

Its a work in progress but part of the how radio calls will work is simlar to this, as I am
currently planning on "warping" the player to "call room", that takes in an argument for a
specific set of text and variables. We'll see how that pans out.

I thought about implementing footsteps as a whole, but as I am not going to have walking or
crouch walking in game, I didn't find it to be worthwhile. What does exist now in game is what
I'm calling "noisy floors". These can be expanded upon for various sounds in the future, and
while currently guards are pretty dumb, and can't see/hear anything, they will be able to in
the future.

I haven't wanted to spend too much time on story or "lore" as while I think, like any Metal
Gear game, that will be an important part, it is something that can be done later. I do have
some various tidbits "on paper", did sort out the overall world map to limit scope, but not
trying to have this be a narrative exercise. Below is what a version one of what the world map
looks like. Its not shown but a "version zero" of the first level also exists, in pencil (which
means its 100% subject to change).

It is not shown in this week's video but I completed very basic pathing for patrols, and the
guard animates correctly based on their movement. Guards, like in Ghost Babel (ando other Metal
Gear games), will have various colors/sprites for their region but I need a base "guard" object
that everything can inherit from, and that is what I am working on.

One last thing that was shown was how the camera follows the player throughout the level. If we
look back at last week's video we see a very small sprite, and are zoomed out quite far. One
thing all Metal Gear games have is a relatively zoomed in camera on the player, to not only
show neat animations but also have it be a challenge to spot all the enemies on the map. I
looked at Ghost Babel's proportions and while not exactly the same, it is a similar size (the
player sprite) on the screen.

And that's really it. Along with working on the "call/radio" system, I'm workong on when the
player can "hug" the wall. This will move the viewport in one direction or the other, and a
player will be able to "knock" on the wall to distract a nearby guard.
