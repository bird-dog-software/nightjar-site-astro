"Bird Dog" (BD) is a private intelligence corporation hired by NATO. Its a fast reaction outfit, able
to provide intelligence, reconaissance and act when neccessary. They act as a proxy, so if any BD
member is captured, NATO nations can disavow their involvement.

Nightjar, a specialist in infiltration and BD operative, is dropped into Radngi, a South Asian
country near India. He is tasked with finding Roseburrow, a British scientist who has gone rogue. Before
Roseburrow went missing, he was working on a technology mysteriously called "The Monkey's Paw". He fled
to the wilds of Radngi and with the help of former BD operatives, Osprey and Shrike. He is trying to
develop "The Monkey's Paw" further and sell it off to various nations. How Osprey and Shrike came to
work for Roseburrow is unknown.

What "The Monkey's Paw" exactly is, is unknown to Nightjar and Bird Dog, but a sample of it fits in
a cannister approximately the size of a soda can.

All that is known before Nightjar arrives on scene was that Shrike and Osprey had some sort of disagreement.
Shrike sent a radio call out to Bird Dog, but has gone silent since. Finding and rescuing Shrike is
an additional part of the mission, but the focus remains on obtaining "The Monkey's Paw", and returning
Roseburrow to the British... alive, if possible. Additionally, while Osprey has sided with Roseburrow,
Bird Dog would like Nightjar not to kill her, so she can be brought in for questioning.

Nightjar is aided by:
- Cuckooo, his commanding officer and former SAS member
- Para-Keet, an intelligence officer with battlefield weaponry knowledge and is a medical doctor who
previously worked with Korean "Black Berets"

- Need to add a splash of Tinker Tailor's "finding the mole" perhaps
-- e.g. Ricky Tar trying to save the dead woman
-- Karl Gastman
