cuckoo:

good morning nightjar.

nightjar:

bit of a rude wake up call. ripped me out of bed in the middle of the night. my... guest... wasn't too thrilled.

para:

oh a guest? i see. and i thought i was going to have a chance with the famous nightjar.

nightjar:

and you are?

cuckoo:

para-keet. she's our new tech. former medic and Black Beret.

nightjar:

so why am i here?

cuckoo:

internal affairs. Do you know Vulture?

nightjar:

Scientist. Work in R&D. A bit eccentric for my liking.

cuckoo:

he, Shrike, the CQC specialist, and Osprey the sniping specialist, were working for one of our... clients...
when Vulture had a breakthrough. he found a way to cause highly acidic rain in a localized area. one
that could directly harm humans significantly.

right now, he only has the ability to cause rain in a very nearby area, but he and Osprey left our
client, hired some muscle, and are currently hiding out while he refines the tech for the highest bidder.

nightjar:

And Shrike?

cuckoo:

Shrike was taken prisoner, when it seems he didn't want to work with Osprey and Vulture. Find him, set
him free. He may be able to give you some good intel as well.

we've been given 24 hours to clean up our own mess before our client sends in an airstrike to wipe any
trace of what they were paying Vulture to work on.

nightjar:

what's my infiltration method?

cuckoo:

you'll HALO jump onto an incoming cargo truck. that should take you to the garage area and from there
you can make your way to the lab.
